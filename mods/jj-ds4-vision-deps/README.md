# mods/jj-ds4-vision-deps

Runtime dependency stack for the DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp recipe (vLLM
`local-inference-lab` PR #634 on b12x).

This mod covers the parts that must apply **at container start** and therefore
work against the *existing* `vllm-node-b12x` image: the b12x source overlay
(pure Python/JIT, no rebuild) and the LMCache build/install (dev-lineage
engine-driven source, **not** the old PR #44 tree).

The vision feature itself — **vLLM PR #634** — is NOT merged into the
`dev/jovian-judgement` branch, so it must be **baked into the vLLM build** at
image-build time. The recipe does that via
`build-and-copy.sh --exp-b12x --rebuild-vllm --apply-vllm-pr 634`
(the `--exp-b12x` profile builds from `local-inference-lab/vllm` ref
`dev/jovian-judgement`; PR #634 is fetched as patch from that same fork via
`pull/634/head` and applied onto the ref — verified clean 3-way apply, 10
commits / 40 files).

The other two vLLM-side deps in the stack — **#553** (engine-driven LMCache +
expandable CUDA allocator segments) and **#671** (fused padded-query output
accounting) — are **already present in `dev/jovian-judgement`** in equivalent
form (confirmed in `vllm/config/vllm.py` `engine_driven` + expandable-segments
paths, and the caller-owned `q_out` kernel contract). They do NOT need
`--apply-vllm-pr`; adding them is a no-op (Docker skips already-applied
patches). These two are not applied by this mod at runtime either — they are
build-baked, and an image built from the branch already carries them.

## What it does (in `run.sh`, idempotent)

1. **b12x overlay** — copies 7 files over the installed `b12x` package
   (found via `import b12x`, not hardcoded). b12x is a pure Python/JIT
   package, so source overlays are enough; kernels recompile on first use.

   | file | source | PR |
   |---|---|---|
   | `attention/_shared/mla/prefill.py` | PR #301 head | FP8 dual-cache prefill, sparse topk-512 |
   | `attention/_shared/mla/prefill_mg.py` | PR #301 head | same |
   | `comm/pcie/_cute_intrinsics.py` | PR #246 head | TP2 peer-push fix |

   | `norm/mhc/_impl.py` | PR #306 head | `rms_eps=1e-20` allowance |

   (`local-inference-lab/b12x` PRs #301, #246, #306 — all open. #306's exact
   change is _also_ already present in `master`, but the baked image is on
   `b58f34ea` which predates it, so we include `_impl.py` too.)

   Post-overlay checks: `MHC_SUPPORTED_RMS_EPS` must contain `1e-20`, and all
   7 modules import clean.

2. **LMCache install (dev + 5 follow-up PRs, vendored tarball)** —
   `lmcache-dev5-src.tar.gz` (2.2M) is a vendored, gzip'd copy of the LMCache
   `dev` branch (`7ed46754`) onto which the five follow-up PRs from vLLM
   PR #634's runtime-dependency list — #49, #50, #51, #55, #56 — have been
   cherry-picked (each applies cleanly because all five branch from `dev`
   HEAD). `PR_SOURCE` inside the archive records the `dev` base + every PR
   commit. The archive contains `lmcache/` + `csrc/` + build scaffolding only
   (tests/docs/examples excluded, `__pycache__`/`*.pyc`/`build`/`*.egg-info`
   stripped), matching the #44 tarball convention. `run.sh` extracts it to a
   writable `/tmp` dir (setuptools writes `build/` into the source root, and
   mod trees may be mounted read-only), then installs with
   ```bash
   uv pip install --no-build-isolation --no-deps <staged>
   ```
   `--no-build-isolation` is required: the repo's pyproject build-system pins
   `torch==2.13.0` (matching the image torch 2.13.0+cu130, but build isolation
   would still re-resolve) — skipping build isolation uses the image's own
   torch/toolchain (verified present: torch 2.13.0+cu130, ninja, gcc/g++,
   nvcc, wheel, cuda-python). `--no-deps` avoids re-resolving deps the image
   already provides (redis/cufile are optional storage backends, intentionally
   not pulled; vLLM uses the gpu/disk backend). `SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION`
   is exported because setuptools_scm wants a git tree and the vendored dir is
   not git. Verified afterwards that the engine-driven modules import and the
   follow-up markers are present (`PagedKVTransferWorkspace` = #50,
   `dynamically_pinned` in `scatter_cpu_to_paged_kv` = #55,
   `engine_driven_shm_pool` in `EngineDrivenTransferModule` = #56), i.e. it is
   the dev+5 source, not a dev / 0.5.x wheel LMCache.

   > **#44 is intentionally superseded.** vLLM PR #634's dependency list used
   > to name LMCache `#44` (`release/v0.5.2-glm52-dcp-base` lineage). As of the
   > 2026-09-07 update to #634, #44 is *gone* — replaced by the five dev-lineage
   > PRs #49/#50/#51/#55/#56. The dev engine-driven path is a different
   > implementation from #44's (it has no `EngineDrivenContextPickle`; the
   > context lives in `worker_transfer.py` as `EngineDrivenTransferContext`).
   > Build the dev+5 source, **not** #44 or any `release/v0.5.x` wheel, whose
   > engine-driven path would not match what #634's launcher expects.

3. **flashinfer — no-op.** The baked flashinfer `0.6.18`
   (git commit `18e5811d`) already contains the SM120 sparse-MLA topk-512
   fallback plus the `extra_page_block_size==2` dispatch that PR/commit
   `803c4664` (flashinfer-ai/flashinfer) adds. Verified: `csrc/sparse_mla_sm120_prefill.cu`
   in `18e5811d` already has the `extra_page_block_size == 2` branch.

## Provenance / verification

- b12x PR heads: `#301=223f88c2`, `#246=ea76030d`, `#306=3f6896dc`
  (local-inference-lab/b12x, all open, base on master history).
- LMCache: base `dev` @ `7ed46754`, plus the five follow-up PRs #49/#50/#51/#55/#56
  cherry-picked on top (see `PR_SOURCE` for the exact commit list; combined tree
  HEAD `14f4b013`). The `release/v0.5.2-glm52-dcp-base` lineage (#44's base) is
  deprecated for this stack — #634 no longer depends on #44.
- **LMCache follow-up PRs** in the #634 stack (all vendored INTO this tarball):
  #49 (restart-safe fs keys), #50 (reuse paged transfer metadata), #51 (bounded
  shared-memory ownership), #55 (asynchronous-copy lifetime synchronization),
  #56 (transport identity reporting). They are no longer "boundaries to check";
  they are the active LMCache DNA for the #634 engine-driven path.
- **vLLM build-side deps** (baked at image build, not by this mod):
  - `#634` — DeepSeek V4 Vision (+ DSpark drafter, streaming checkpoint
    loader, qualified LMCache profiles). NOT in the branch: **must** be
    applied via `--apply-vllm-pr 634`. Verified clean 3-way apply onto
    `dev/jovian-judgement` (10 commits / 40 files).
  - `#553` — engine-driven LMCache + expandable CUDA allocator segments.
    Already present in `dev/jovian-judgement` (equivalent code in
    `vllm/config/vllm.py`); no `--apply-vllm-pr` needed.
  - `#671` — fused padded-query output accounting before GPU KV admission.
    Already present in `dev/jovian-judgement` (caller-owned `q_out` kernel
    contract); no `--apply-vllm-pr` needed.
- flashinfer commit `803c4664` (flashinfer-ai/flashinfer, not a branch head).

| vLLM | #553 engine-driven LMCache + expandable-CUDA segments | already in `dev/jovian-judgement` |
| vLLM | #671 fused padded-query output accounting | already in `dev/jovian-judgement` |
| LMCache | dev base + **#49/#50/#51/#55/#56** (engine-driven; **replaces #44**) | this mod (vendored install) |
| FlashInfer | `803c4664` SM120 sparse-MLA topk-512 fallback | baked in image flashinfer 0.6.18 (no-op today) |

## Testing

- Overlay logic verified in a temp container (`vllm-node-b12x:latest`):
  `MHC_SUPPORTED_RMS_EPS` goes `(1e-06,1e-05)` → `(1e-20,1e-06,1e-05)`, 7
  modules import clean.
- LMCache dev+5 build path: verified in the same container — `uv pip install
  --no-build-isolation --no-deps` on the vendored tree builds in ~48s, installs
  `0.5.2.post0+jjdev5.7ed4675404...`, and the post-install marker checks pass
  (`PagedKVTransferWorkspace`, `dynamically_pinned`, `engine_driven_shm_pool`).
  `verify.sh` reports ALL PASS; re-running `run.sh` is a no-op.
- End-to-end: exercise via `launch-cluster.sh` with this mod applied (needs
  network + HTTP(S)_PROXY, GPU image). See the recipe's
  `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp.yaml`.
